# osx_apps-AbracaAppIT
A basic shell script wrapped as osx app to allow you to create osx apps out of shell scripts.

This was developed as an IT helper originally and became quite useful over time.  The premise was to write scripts for the one off use cases and give users an easy way of using them, hence turning a script into a button push.

For user input osascript is used for a more native look.  This is also a good example of how to use osascript in CL to accomplish the execution of a script (and admin like actions) by an average user.
