#AbracaAppIT
A basic shell script wrapped as osx app to allow you to create osx apps out of shell scripts.

This concept came to me as an IT admin, I had several one off cases where users needed to do something that was to complex or that they didn't really have rights/auth to do.

I began to write little programs and then wrap them up as an osx app to allow easy execution.

This project works as a helper and as an example of how to create an app and capture user input for the result.  For user interaction osascript is used. This gives your script a very native feel and the app format really discourages the average user to not dig any deeper.
